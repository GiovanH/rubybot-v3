"**No politics, no porn, and no spoilers!**\n\nPlease keep discussion of things Lore hasn't seen yet to the spoilerchat! \n\nPlease don't push Lore on when he's doing an episode. It's stressful and unnecessary. Be polite! \n\n**Current important spoiler topics:**\n==No Undertale, Hiveswap, or Persona 5 discussion at all outside the spoilerchat until he finishes those games\n==No Steven Universe, Madoka Magica, or Wander Over Yonder past his latest liveblog\n==No Star vs the Forces of Evil, the new Ducktales, Miraculous Ladybug, Samurai Jack, RWBY past S2, or other potential liveblog shows (ask if you're unsure!) until he starts those liveblogs.\nAgain, if you're not certain about other things he could get spoiled on, go ahead and ask!  If you don't know what's an acceptable hint or leading question, read this please: http://loreweaver-universe.tumblr.com/post/175378660514/a-psa-about-spoilery-questions\n\nPlease also keep all Adventure Time, My Hero Academia, Homestuck, and Worm talk to their respective chats, as Minda, Kat, Niki, and Krix are liveblogging them respectively; we all know how spoilery those can get.  Also, please be considerate of anyone making their way through The Adventure Zone in chat!  We've got half a dozen people experiencing that for the first time as well!\n\nKeep nonsense-posting to Frog Jail, and **above all be excellent to each other.**"

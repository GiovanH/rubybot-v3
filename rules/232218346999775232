**No politics, no porn, and no spoilers!**

Please keep discussion of things Lore hasn't seen yet to the spoilerchat! 

Please don't push Lore on when he's doing an episode. It's stressful and unnecessary. Be polite! 

**Current important spoiler topics:**
==No Undertale discussion at all outside the spoilerchat until he finishes the game
==No Steven Universe past his latest liveblog
==No Madoka Magica, Star vs the Forces of Evil, the new Ducktales, Miraculous Ladybug, Samurai Jack, or RWBY past S2 until he starts those liveblogs.
 if you're not certain about other things he could get spoiled on, go ahead and ask!

Please also keep all Homestuck and Worm talk to their respective chats, as Minda and Krix are liveblogging them, and we all know how spoilery that can get.

Keep nonsense-posting to Frog Jail, and **above all be excellent to each other.**

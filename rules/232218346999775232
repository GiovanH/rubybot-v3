**No politics, no porn, and no spoilers!**

Please keep discussion of things Lore hasn't seen yet to the spoilerchat! 

Please don't push Lore on when he's doing an episode. It's stressful and unnecessary. Be polite! 

**Current important spoiler topics:**
==No Undertale, Hiveswap, or Persona 5 discussion at all outside the spoilerchat until he finishes those games
==No Steven Universe, Madoka Magica, or Wander Over Yonder past his latest liveblog
==No Star vs the Forces of Evil, the new Ducktales, Miraculous Ladybug, Samurai Jack, RWBY past S2, or other potential liveblog shows (ask if you're unsure!) until he starts those liveblogs.
Again, if you're not certain about other things he could get spoiled on, go ahead and ask!

Please also keep all Adventure Time and Worm talk to their respective chats, as Minda and Krix are liveblogging them, and we all know how spoilery that can get.

Keep nonsense-posting to Frog Jail, and **above all be excellent to each other.**

**No politics, no porn, and no spoilers!**

Please keep discussion of things Lore hasn't seen yet to the spoilerchat! 

Please don't push Lore on when he's doing an episode. It's stressful and unnecessary. Be polite! 

**Current important spoiler topics:** 
==No Undertale discussion *at all* outside the spoilerchat until he finishes the game
==No Steven Universe past his latest liveblog
==No Over the Garden Wall, Madoka Magica, Star vs the forces of evil, the new Ducktales, Samurai Jack or RWBY S2 until he starts those liveblogs.
 if you're not certain about other things he could get spoiled on, go ahead and ask!

Please also keep all Homestuck talk to the Homestuck chat, as Minda is liveblogging it, and we all know how spoilery that can get.

Keep nonsense-posting to The Pit, and **above all be excellent to each other.**
